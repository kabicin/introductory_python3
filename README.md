### :one: Learn
- This section of the repository contains a collection of my annotated notes on various algorithms and/or puzzles.

### :two: Practice
- Assess your learning by attempting the practice problems which come alongside many docstring tests and unittests.
- Each practice problem set comes with two files. One is the working file, <b>practice_x.py</b> and the other, the unittest file, <b>practice_x_unittest.py</b>.
- To check answers, an additional <b>practice_x_solutions.py</b> file may be provided.
